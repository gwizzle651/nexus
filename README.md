# Nexus Project
#### Nexus is an application created by **Sentinels' Forge**.
Nexus is primarily a database for storing all sorts of data that its users desire, almost functioning like a forum.
The whole application is monitored closely by the administrator and the team of moderators. Around the database is a chat room that the users can use to communicate and share ideas freely. The final layer of **Nexus** that has been implemented is the CRIS, for users to gain rewards for contributions to the database. These credits may be spent on ranks or anything else in the shop. As of now, there is not a set release date.
